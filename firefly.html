  <h1>HESTIA “FIREFLY” ABRAMS: STARFALL CRUSADER</h1>

  <a href="trivia.html" id="back-button" onclick="playSound(event)">&larr; RETURN</a>

  <div class="container">
    <div id="blurb">
      <p><strong>Hestia “Firefly” Abrams</strong>, <strong>19</strong>. She/Her. Elfling. Fire-born and steel-bound.</p>

      <p>High atop Ernestop Mountain, Hestia lives among the mist and wind — a spark contained by circuitry. Her fire used to threaten her life, burning from within, until a sleek cybernetic exoskeleton saved her. Now? That fire fuels everything: her travel, her battles, her cooking (albeit slightly charred).</p>

      <p>She’s sharp-witted, heat-tempered, and fiercely independent. She doesn’t take orders well — especially when it comes to the Plaguebringers. Their existence sets her teeth on edge and her circuits to glow. When Charles offers to help defeat them, Firefly steps forward. Not to thank him. To challenge him. This fight is hers.</p>

      <p>She laughs like a crackling flame. She fights like a wildfire. She loves like a hearthfire — warm, rare, and fiercely protected.</p>

      <p>Don’t try to put her out. Just try to keep up.</p>
