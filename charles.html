      <p><strong>Charles Couckee</strong>, 19. He/Him. Pansexual. First to rise, and first to carry the banner of the Starfall Crusaders.</p>

      <p>A genuine heart with a restless mind, Charles spends his rare free moments sketching blueprints or doodling characters that may never make it into reality. His room? An organized chaos of half-built gadgets and colorful tools.</p>

      <p>He leads not because he wants to — but because someone has to, and no one else will. With his Star Power balanced across multiple disciplines, Charles is the team's flexible backbone, always adapting to meet the chaos head-on.</p>

      <p>He's the kind of friend who’d fix your bike at 2 a.m. and still apologize for waking you with the clanking tools. Loyal to a fault, protective to the end — even if it means putting himself last.</p>

      <p>One day, he’ll take a break. Until then, he’ll keep moving forward… even if he’s running on fumes and friendship.</p>
