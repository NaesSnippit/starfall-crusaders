  <h1>✦ DIAMOND’S BLACKJACK BOOTH</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="section-title">Booth #212 — COMET FESTIVAL, 2025</div>
    <p>Looking for an easy win? Booth #212 has just what you need: a simple blackjack table run by a sweet 9-year-old named Diamond. She smiles, she shuffles, she deals — what could go wrong?</p>

    <p>Games are just <strong>$10 per play</strong>. Beat the dealer, and you win <strong>cold, hard cash</strong>. Seriously. Diamond pays out from a glittery tin lunchbox labeled “NOT A BANK.”</p>

    <p>She looks innocent. She even wears nerdy round glasses. But don’t let that fool you — rumor has it she’s never lost a game all weekend. Some say her deck's just lucky. Others say she's got tricks in those sleeves.</p>

    <p>Still, a few lucky winners have walked away with more than $100 in a single session. Will you be one of them?</p>

    <div class="section-title">House Rules</div>
    <ul id="house-rules">
      <li>$10 per hand — exact change only, no IOUs.</li>
      <li>No touching the cards. Seriously. Don’t.</li>
      <li>Blackjack pays 2:1, unless Diamond says otherwise.</li>
      <li>If she catches you counting cards, you owe her bubble tea.</li>
      <li>All disputes resolved by a coin toss… flipped by Diamond.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="section-title">Try Your Luck… For Real!</div>
    <p>Think you can beat the system? Play an actual round of blackjack against Diamond’s shady computer dealer. The cards are stacked (probably). The vibes are chill. The stakes are high.</p>
