    <div id="blurb">
      <p><strong>Percival "Percy" Feliguire</strong>, 19. He/Him. Bisexual. Gaoyama exile from the shattered realm of Aegis Mountain.</p>

      <p>Cast out from his home dimension for reasons he won't fully explain (and you probably wouldn’t believe), Percy now drifts with the Starfall Crusaders, claiming it’s “temporary” — though he’s been here longer than most.</p>

      <p>Armed with razor wit and a perpetual smirk, he challenges everyone — not because he’s malicious, but because arguing is the closest thing he has to joy. If he's not picking apart your logic, he's probably asleep or bored.</p>

      <p>He's convinced Stellar’s going to stab them all in the back. He’ll say it with a laugh, but there’s steel behind the joke. Underneath the sarcasm is someone who's been betrayed one too many times… and isn't ready to trust again.</p>

      <p>He fights like he talks: clever, unpredictable, and never quite where you expect him to be. Whether he's an ally or a liability depends entirely on the day — and your tolerance for snark.</p>
